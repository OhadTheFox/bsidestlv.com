# Adversarial Mindset Village

This one's for those with a bit of the outlaw in them. It's all about learning how to think like the bad guys, emulating their tactics, techniques, and procedures to fortify your own defenses. After all, if you want to catch a bandit, you've got to think like a bandit.

## Our Vision
The Adversarial Mindset is a dynamic and engaging community initiative that's all about Adversary simulation, Adversary Tactics, Life, Adversary Philosophy, Threat Actors Emulation, and Purple Teaming. Our goal is to provide a platform for professionals and enthusiasts to hone their skills and develop new tactics, techniques, and procedures to combat modern cyber threats. At BSidesTLV, we'll host technical talks, live demos, panel discussions, and hands-on activities to help you explore the latest tools and techniques in Adversary simulation and Purple teaming and to help you understand better the attackers' mindset and TTP, to create better defensive and offensive capabilities. Whether you're a seasoned cybersecurity pro or just starting out, we've got something for everyone. Join us at the Adversarial Mindset, and let's make a tangible impact on the cybersecurity world together!


### Opening Session: Becoming A Better Adversary
**Gal Bitansky**
We can always learn a new trick, unlock a new achievement - or just get better. This talk will discuss the complex relationship with defenders and how it can make you a better person (by assisting them to better prepare for a real adversary) and a better red teamer (by learning their limitations). We will provide concrete scenarios and practical lessons from our personal experience.

### A ransomware battle royal: The cybersecurity battle you can't afford to lose
**By  Danna Pelleg, Sharon Fisher**
In this "Ransomware Battle Royal" session, we will explore the different motivations behind these attacks, such as financial gain through Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and geopolitical motives of various groups. We will also discuss the high-level kill chain of a destructive ransomware attack and the various techniques used in these attacks, including real-life examples. Through this session, attendees will better understand the latest tactics ransomware attackers use and learn how to protect their businesses from these dangerous threats. Whether you are a cybersecurity professional, a business owner, or simply interested in the evolving threat landscape, this session is a must-attend. Join us for an informative and engaging discussion on the cybersecurity battle you can't afford to lose.

### Keynote: Red Team Tales: 7 Years of Physical Penetration Testing 
**By: Justin Wynn**
Have you ever wondered how physical penetration tests are conducted? What it would be like to actually rob a bank or how someone can gain access to the most physically secure buildings in existence? Is it really as easy as walking through the front door and asking to visit the server closet, or are people creeping in at the middle of the night, face painted, wearing tactile-necks? The answer is YES. 
In this exclusive presentation, I'll be covering 7 action-packed years of physical penetration tests, with stories of breaking into banks, water treatment facilities, skyscrapers in NYC, courthouses in Iowa, and cheese-packing facilities in the middle of nowhere. We'll turn everything you know about physical security upside down - case in point, the cheese factory was by far the most secure. I'll show you how we did it, the characters we met along the way, and share some of the greatest never before told stories.

### AI Red Teaming LLM's 
**by: Alex Polyakov**
Explore the world of AI Red Teaming Large Language Models (LLMs) - their origins, current challenges, and future possibilities. With advancements in ChatGPT and other LLMs, risks such as data extraction, prompt injection, jailbreaks, poisoning, and logic manipulation attacks remain. As LLMs become more common in business applications, it is crucial to have AI Red Teaming skills.

### Reconnaissance for Red Teamers
**By: Lior Sibonny Leibovitz**
This session will dive into OSINT and recon world in the black hat hackers and red teamers. we will discuss the difference between those approaches and learn about techniques and usage of relevant tools.

### Panel Discussion: From Intelligence to Adversary Simulation 
**Moderator: Stav Shulman**
Panelists: Ido Rozen, Dr Amit Elazari, Hanna Meyerfeld

### Closing Keynote: Finding Your Adversarial Voice 
**by Jamie Williams**
Adversary emulation is all about seeing and feeling systems from the perspective of an adversary, but unlike real adversaries we can't forget to capture and deliver this wisdom to our friends the defenders.
